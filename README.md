# Class Demo site for the Academic Template for [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

This is a demo site for Richard Ressler's classes on the Hugo **Academic ResumÃ© Template**. That template empowers you to create your job-winning online resumÃ© and showcase your academic publications.

You can edit your site in Markdown, or RStudio (via Blogdown), generate it with Hugo, and deploy with GitHub or Netlify. Customize anything on your site with widgets, themes, and language packs.
